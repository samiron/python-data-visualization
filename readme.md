# Visualize Data with Python
You can use either google colab or just use your own jupyter instance to run the notebooks. Following steps are shown if you are going to use Google Colab.

## Prerequisite
You must be familiar with computer programming concept. Being familiar with python is an advantage but not strictly required. 

## Contents

**`python-basics`:** The notebooks in this folder is to give a quick brush up on common python syntax. If you are not familiar with python already its encouraged to start from here.

## Start off
Based on how you want to proceed, click any of the following options:
* [Just want to try for once](#just-want-to-try-for-once).
* [I will start and want to receive further updates](#i-will-start-and-want-to-receive-further-updates).

### Just want to try for once

**In Google Colab**
* Just open http://colab.research.google.com/github/samiron/python-data-visualization.
* Select the ipynb file you want to try out.

**In your computer**
* Just clone the repository or download the project from GitHub.com
* Play around with the ipynb file.

### I will start and want to receive further updates

**Do this for once**
* Fork this repository. 
* The forked repository URL should look like github.com/YOUR_NAME/python-data-visualization
* You are the owner of this forked repository.

**Open your desired file in Google Colab**
* Open http://colab.research.google.com/github/YOUR_NAME
  * _You may need to allow your browser to show popups_
* You should see the list of .ipynb file in a popup.
* Click the one you want to work on.
* Happy coding!!

**Saving your changes to your GitHub repository**
* Open `File` > `Save a copy in GitHub`.
* You should see a popup. It should already populate the values for `Repository`, `File Path` and `Branch`.
* You must provide a meaningful commit message.
* (Optional) You may also want to add a link to this colab file in the commit message. This is usually helpful to open the colab file afterwards right from the commit message.
* Click `OK`.

**Pull updates from parent**
* You will need to create a pull request from parent to your repository. For instance, `samiron/python-data-visualization` **->** `YOUR_NAME/python-data-visualization`
